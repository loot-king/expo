**EAS Build** is a hosted service for building app binaries for your Expo and React Native projects. It makes building your apps for distribution super easy by providing defaults that work well for Expo and React Native projects out of the box and by handling your app signing credentials for you, if you would like it to. It is also configurable where needed, in case your app has custom build requirements. It will one day replace the existing build service entirely.

> ⚠️ **Building managed Expo projects is not yet supported**, but we are working on bringing it to EAS Build! If you wish to build a managed Expo project with EAS Build, you'll have to eject it first. See the [Ejecting to Bare Workflow](../../workflow/customizing/) page to learn how.
